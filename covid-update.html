    <p class="art_text">On Wednesday 21nd April, Denmark is starting to ease up on the lock down restrictions. The big
        shopping centers will be opening again as well as restaurants and bars.<br><br>

        To eat inside at a restaurant you must show a negative covid-19 test carried out within the last 72 hours.
        However, a covid-19 test is not required to eat and drink outside.<br><br>

        We still highly advise that you take extra care and keep your distance when around a lot of people and remember
        to bring a mask and hand sanitiser.
