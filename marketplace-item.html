    <p class="art_text"><b>MISSING!</b><br>
        Our beloved lawnmower Larry was sadly stolen last night, we believe between the hours of 2am and 6am. <br><br>

        Larry has always been there for us to help keep our grass short and tidy and we miss him dearly. <br><br>

        If anyone has seen Larry or knows any knowledge of his whereabouts, we would really appreciate it if you would
        inform the student administration team so that they can help Larry find his way back home. <br><br>

        Please share this article with your family and friends and use #FindLarryLawnmower to help us bring Larry back
        home.
